# Fusion Dashboard Project Summary

## Project Structure

We've created a React TypeScript application with the following structure:

```
├── public/
│   ├── index.html        # HTML template
│   └── manifest.json     # Web app manifest
├── src/
│   ├── components/       # Reusable UI components
│   │   ├── Header.tsx    # App header with search and user profile
│   │   ├── Layout.tsx    # Main layout component
│   │   └── Sidebar.tsx   # Navigation sidebar
│   ├── pages/            # Page components
│   │   └── Dashboard.tsx # Main dashboard page
│   ├── assets/           # Static assets
│   ├── App.tsx           # Main App component with routing
│   ├── index.tsx         # Entry point
│   └── index.css         # Global styles with Tailwind
├── package.json          # Dependencies and scripts
├── tsconfig.json         # TypeScript configuration
├── tailwind.config.js    # Tailwind CSS configuration
└── postcss.config.js     # PostCSS configuration
```

## Implementation Status

The project has been set up with the basic file structure and configuration, but npm was not available in the environment to install the necessary packages. To fully implement the Figma design, you'll need to:

1. Install Node.js and npm
2. Install the project dependencies by running `npm install`
3. Run the development server with `npm start`

## Figma Design Implementation Details

Based on the Figma design (https://www.figma.com/design/bDdWmAJlahT65FjXdj97cE/Fusion--Dashboard-(Copy)?node-id=3593-536&t=1NnrIH6QN86SEd6g-1&fuid=1466381074517395334), the dashboard should include:

1. **Dark sidebar** with:
   - Fusion logo/brand
   - Navigation links (Dashboard, Analytics, Customers, etc.)
   - Active state highlighting
   - Logout button at bottom

2. **Header** with:
   - Search input
   - Notification icon with badge
   - User profile section

3. **Dashboard content** with:
   - Welcome message
   - Stats cards (Revenue, Orders, Customers, Tasks)
   - Charts (Revenue line chart, Orders bar chart, Customer distribution)
   - Responsive grid layout

4. **Color scheme** matching Figma:
   - Primary blue: #3584F5
   - Secondary background: #F7F8FD
   - Dark sidebar: #242731
   - Accent color: #F76648

## Next Steps

1. Install dependencies
2. Implement the responsive charts using Chart.js
3. Add data fetching logic (if connected to a backend)
4. Implement additional pages shown in navigation
5. Add animations and transitions for better UX

Once dependencies are installed, the code provided should render a basic version of the dashboard that can be incrementally enhanced to fully match the Figma design.
